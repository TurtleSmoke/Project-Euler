### You can find the conventions in [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

I don't apply particular rules concerning the code base since it is not the
purpose of this repository. However, the code **must** be understandable, which
means that it must not be an ugly one-liner. Performance is not the goal here.

Note that I might reject your pull request simply because I don't think it's an
interesting feature to add.
