I don't apply any special rules concerning the code base since it is not the
purpose of this repository. However, the code **must** be understandable, which
means that it should not be an 'ugly one-liner'. Performance is not sought here.

Note that I could refuse your pull request simply because I don't think it's an
interesting feature to add.
