# Dynamic programming

The [Summation minus summation](solution2.md) solution gives an interesting
solution because we found the sum of the primes less than \\( n \\) with only
the primes less than \\( \sqrt{n} \\). Unfortunately, this solution is not
efficient because it requires too much recursion for larger n.

The main problem with the previous solution was to remove the numbers that were
multiples of previous primes. For example with the multiples of \\( 3 \\), the
number \\( 6 \\) was already removed by the multiples of \\( 2 \\).

What we really want is to remove the multiples of \\( 3 \\) that have not
already been removed by the multiples of \\( 2 \\) such as \\( 6 \\), \\( 12 \\)
... For \\( 5 \\) that would be the number that are neither multiples of \\( 2
\\) nor \\( 3 \\).

Instead of the sum of the multiples of a prime, we will search for the sum of
integer that remain after sieving with all primes smaller than the current one.

This solution is well explained by **Lucy_Hedgehog** in this
[thread](https://projecteuler.net/thread=10;page=5#111677) (only available if
you solve the problem):

From [solution3.py](https://github.com/TurtleSmoke/Project-Euler/blob/main/problems/problem_0010/solution3.py):

```python
def partial_prime_sum(n=2000000):
    r = ceil(sqrt(n))
    V = [n // i for i in range(1, r + 1)]
    V += list(range(V[-1] - 1, 0, -1))
    S = {i: i * (i + 1) // 2 - 1 for i in V}
    for p in range(2, r + 1):
        if S[p] > S[p - 1]:  # p is prime
            sp = S[p - 1]  # sum of primes smaller than p
            p2 = p * p
            for v in V:
                if v < p2: break
                S[v] -= p * (S[v // p] - sp)
    return S[n]
```
