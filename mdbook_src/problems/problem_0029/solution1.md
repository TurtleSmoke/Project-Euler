# Brute force

Using
python's [{} set comprehension](https://python-reference.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/comprehensions/set_comprehension.html)
we can create a set with all the terms generated by the sequence: \\( a^b \\).
Since a set discards duplicate elements, the solution is the length of that set.

```python
def distinct_powers(n=100):
    return len({a ** b for a in range(2, n + 1) for b in range(2, n + 1)})
```
