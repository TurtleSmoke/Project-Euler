# [Sub-string divisibility](https://projecteuler.net/problem=43)

> The number, \\( 1406357289 \\), is a \\( 0 \\) to \\( 9 \\) pandigital number because it is made up of each of the digits \\( 0 \\) to \\( 9 \\) in some order, but it also has a rather interesting sub-string divisibility property.
> 
> Let \\( d_1 \\) be the \\( 1^{st} \\) digit, \\( d_2 \\) be the \\( 2^{nd} \\) digit, and so on. In this way, we note the following:
> 
> \\[
> \begin{align}
> &d_2d_3d_4=406\\text{ is divisible by }2\\\\
> &d_3d_4d_5=063\text{ is divisible by }3\\\\
> &d_4d_5d_6=635\text{ is divisible by }5\\\\
> &d_5d_6d_7=357\text{ is divisible by }7\\\\
> &d_6d_7d_8=572\text{ is divisible by }11\\\\

> Find the sum of all \\( 0 \\) to \\( 9 \\) pandigital numbers with this property.
