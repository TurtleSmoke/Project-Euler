# [Triangular, pentagonal, and hexagonal](https://projecteuler.net/problem=45)

> Triangle, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers are generated by the following formulae:
>
> \\[
> \begin{align*}
> &\text{Triangle }&&Tn=\frac{n(n+1)}{2} &&1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ...\\\\
> &\text{Pentagonal }&&Pn=\frac{n(3n−1)}{2} && 1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ...\\\\
> &\text{Hexagonal }&&Hn=n(2n−1) &&1, 6, 15, 28, 45, ...\\\\
> \end{align*}
> \\]
> It can be verified that \\( T_{285} = P_{165} = H_{143} = 40755 \\).
>
> Find the next triangle number that is also pentagonal and hexagonal.
