# [Diophantine equation](https://projecteuler.net/problem=66)

> Consider quadratic Diophantine equations of the form:
> 
> \\[
> x^{2} – Dy^{2} = 1
> \\]
> 
> For example, when D\\( = \\)1\\( 3 \\), the minimal solution in \\( x \\) is \\( 6492 - 13 \times 1802=1 \\).
> 
> It can be assumed that there are no solutions in positive integers when \\( D \\) is square.
> 
> By finding minimal solutions in x for \\( D = \\{2, 3, 5, 6, 7\\} \\), we obtain the following:
> 
> \\[
> 3^{2} – 2×2^{2} = 1\\\\\\\\
> 2^{2} – 3×1^{2} = 1\\\\\\\\
> \color{red}{9}^{2} – 5×4^{2} = 1\\\\\\\\
> 5^{2} – 6×2^{2} = 1\\\\\\\\
> 8^{2} – 7×3^{2} = 1
> \\]
> 
> Hence, by considering minimal solutions in \\( x \\) for \\( D \leq 7 \\), the largest \\( x \\) is obtained when \\( D = 5 \\).
> 
> Find the value of \\( D \leq 1000 \\) in minimal solutions of \\( x \\) for which the largest value of \\( x \\) is obtained.
