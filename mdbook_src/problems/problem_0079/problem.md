# [Passcode Derivation](https://projecteuler.net/problem=79)

> A common security method used for online banking is to ask the user for three random characters from a passcode. For example, if the passcode was \\( 531278 \\), they may ask for the \\( 2 \\)nd, \\( 3 \\)rd, and \\( 5 \\)th characters; the expected reply would be: \\( 317 \\).
> 
> The text file, [keylog.txt](https://projecteuler.net/resources/documents/0079_keylog.txt), contains fifty successful login attempts.
> 
> Given that the three characters are always asked for in order, analyse the file so as to determine the shortest possible secret passcode of unknown length.
