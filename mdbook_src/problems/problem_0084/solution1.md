# Markov Chain

## Problem

The problem is to find the most visited squares in a Monopoly game using two dice with 4 sides each.
Most of the rules are similar to the original game and are described in the problem statement.
But some rules are ambiguous, so here is what I did:
- The CC and CH cards are always reshuffled after being used (in the original game they are put at the bottom of the pile).
- The player does not get stuck in jail even if he does not roll a double.
-
